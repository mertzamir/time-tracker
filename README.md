# Time Tracker 
This is a simple Time Tracker application for keeping track of the time spent on various tasks. Important files:

`TimeTracker.daml`: Stores the Daml model that represents a Task. 

`InitializationScript.daml`: Daml script that initializes the ledger with two sample records and does some update/delete operation on them.

`TimeTracker_Test.daml`: Test script that tests different edge cases on the model.

(This simple Time Tracker DAML project is created by Mert Zamir as part of the Digital Asset interview process.)
